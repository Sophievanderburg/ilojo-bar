## :black_nib: About the project
### The problem
Ilojo Bar or Casa do Fernandez was an iconic national monument in Lagos, Nigeria, which was illegally demolished in 2016. Ilojo Bar was designed and built by Africans returning from slavery in Brazil in the 1800s. Legacy would like an English-language website that becomes a virtual monument of this special building and the many stories surrounding it.
