# Ilojo Bar
## Debrief
### Background information
Ilojo Bar or Casa do Fernandez was an iconic national monument in Lagos, Nigeria, which was illegally demolished in 2016. Ilojo Bar was designed and built by Africans returning from slavery in Brazil in the 1800s. Legacy would like an English-language website that becomes a kind of virtual monument of this special building and the many stories surrounding it.

### Reason for the assignment
In 2016, Ilojo bar was demolished while the building was a national monument. The building has had a lot of impact on Lagos and what the area is like today. It is important that these stories are told and that the people of Lagos do not forget the history of their city. That's why Legacy asked us to create a virtual monument.

### Goal of the assignment
The aim is to let as many people as possible know what impact Ilojo bar has had on Lagos. In this way, history can live on without the building still standing.

### Target audience 
The target audience is quite extensive. Legacy wants everyone to be able to view the history of Ilojo bar. But the focus of this project is on the Nigerians and the residents of Lagos.

The people there, mainly reach the internet on their smartphones. It's not always that good though. So that is something we have to consider.
